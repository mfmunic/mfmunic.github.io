  "This is simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with Lizard and Spock added.  It is technically from the show 'The Big Bang Theory', which I have never seen.  So it's actually based on a google search for rock paper scissors.  It was another homework assignment from UCSD.  It is currently written in vanilla Javascript with plans to rewrite it using a different framework in the future.  The multiplayer functionality uses Firebase's Real-time database.  If you and a friend connect to this page and both click multiplayer you can play against each other, with a working chat feature.";
