  "Hello, I'm Marc Munic.  I'm a full-stack web developer.  I completed the UCSD coding bootcamp, where I learned the MERN stack.  Since then, I have had to teach myself AWS, PHP, Drupal, and testing languages such as Jest and Enzyme.  I went to school while working full time at the Mt. Soledad National Veterans Memorial.",
  "While at Mt. Soledad I had started several programs including introducing an app, local Wifi at the monument site, and a living history project of collecting veterans' stories.",
  "Before working at Mt. Soledad, I was a Political Consultant on several local political campaigns.  While working on campaigns, I was on the board of a city planning committee and the local town council.  I started two companies, one specializing in telehealth and one in real estate investment.",
  "I am a veteran as I started my adult career in the US Navy as a mechanic on board the USS Reagan, after going through the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command.  I earned my B.A. at Ashford University, and my joke is I majored in Psychology and have a minor in Nuclear Physics.",
  "I stay busy in San Diego with my wife, my son, and my dog."
