  'In the Game of Hangman you either win or you die.  It is a simple hangman game with a Game of Thrones Theme.  You win by collecting Family banners which are won by guessing the Game of Thrones character. 5 banners wins the game.  It was a homework assignment during my UCSD Extension course, and I have left it up, because it is still fun.   It is currently written in vanilla Javascript, but if I have time I may go back to it and add to it.';
