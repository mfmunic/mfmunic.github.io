I wrote this game initially in jQuery, but I rewrote the whole thing in Angular to impress a hiring manager for an interview.  This biggest challenge for this project was learning the service functionality.  Data passing from parent to child wasn't difficult, but finding an explaination for sending data from child to distant aunt was not as easy.  That is to say, until I stopped looking at third-party tutorials and just read Angular's own documentation.";
