  "You have made it to Marc Munic's Homepage.  It is on a Github Server (if you couldn't figure that out from the URL) and uses React.  It is also using Redux, which I agree, is a bit overkill for such a simple site, but then again I like to keep even the simplest things stupidly scalable.  I learned to use CSS clip-path on the images on the home screen, however since it was not supported I updated the pictures themselves.  I also spent probably more time than I should converting from NPM to Yarn and switching the lock packages, but I had to because I had ran into an issue with my gh-pages package and my es-lint package.  One feature that would never be noticed unless pointed out, is the year in the copyright line is automated to the current year.  There is still plenty of work to do for this site, that I plan to do (i.e. fix the ugly buttons for the rest of this green section)";
