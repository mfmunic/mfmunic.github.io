				<h2>About</h2>
				<br>
				<p> Marc Munic is from San Jose, CA.  He enlisted in the Navy in the spring of 2002 and entered the Naval Nuclear Power Training program.  It is considered the second most challenging program the military has to offer (the first being the SEALs).  He was stationed on the USS Reagan, an aircraft carrier out of Coronado.  After the Navy, he stayed in San Diego.</p>
		 		<br>
				<p>Marc worked at Bridgepoint Education, and took advantage of the company benefit of free education.  He finished his BA in psychology while working full time.  In 2010, he left Bridgepoint and pursued a career in politics.</p>
		 		<br>
				<p>Marc was the campaign manager and consultant for a number of San Diego local campaigns for the 2012 and 2014 election cycles.   During this time he was elected to the boards for the City Heights Area Planning Committee and City Heights Town Council.</p>
		 		<br>
				<p>Marc then went on to be a founding member for a company called Exusmed.  Exusmed was a telehealth company designed to connect patients with their doctors through online portals.</p>
		 		<br>
				<p>Marc currently works for the Mt. Soledad National Veterans Memorial, a 501(c3) that memorializes veterans living and deceased.  In his offtime, he works with his business partner to buy, renovate, and sell single family homes; he still consults on various local political campaigns; and he is attending the UCSD Full Stack Developer bootcamp.  Lastly, he still finds time to spend with his wife, and takes his dog to the beach.</p>
